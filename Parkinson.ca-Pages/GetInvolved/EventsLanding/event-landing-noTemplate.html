<h4>Events this month or Upcoming Events</h4>

<p>List of events based on Event date rather than geographic location. We might have the next 15 events come up here. This would be especially important for virtual events which have no geographic location and get a bit lost in collection of events.</p>
<p>This would be dependent on having good information entered into the events. Right now we're not capturing the date except for a loose text field. We would need to have all events use a date field that could be used to filter events.</p>

Your future gift could be the key to unlocking the mysteries of Parkinson’s disease. Your Will ensures that your family and loved ones are provided for in the future in the way that you want.  After providing for them, a gift through your Will allows you to help others. Gifts made through your Will are an important source of support for Parkinson Canada and they enable you to make a significant gift that you might not have been able to make during your lifetime. A planned gift is a way to support people with Parkinson’s while helping you achieve the peace of mind that comes with completing your Will and leave a lasting legacy.
<h3>Ways to Give:</h3>
<h5 id="bequests">1) Bequests – a charitable gift in your Will</h5>
A bequest is a gift in your Will that can be changed or modified at any time. You can choose to designate that your bequest be used for general use, or perhaps for a specific purpose thereby providing you with the peace of mind knowing that your gift will be used as intended. Bequests are also a meaningful way to reduce estate taxes while supporting Parkinson Canada.

There are a number of ways you can make a bequest to Parkinson Canada
<ol>
 	<li>Specific Bequest: A specific bequest involves making a gift of a specific dollar amount from your estate.</li>
 	<li>Percentage Bequest: This is another type of specific bequest which involves leaving a percentage of your total estate to a charity.</li>
 	<li>Residual Bequest: This form of a bequest is made from the remainder of your estate after all your other provisions have been made. Most common forms of a residual bequest involve leaving a percentage of the residue of your estate to a charity.</li>
 	<li>Contingent Bequest: You could choose to leave specific property, such as a vacation home for example, to a relative or friend, but the bequest language could provide that if this relative is not alive at the time of your death, then the vacation home will go to the charity of your choice.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="life-insurance">2) Gift of Life Insurance</h5>
Through your life insurance you can leave a larger gift than is possible for most people during their lifetime. When you name Parkinson Canada as a beneficiary and/or owner of your life insurance policy, you could benefit from tax savings in your lifetime or tax savings for your estate.
<h5>3) Registered Assets – RRSP’s and RRIF’s</h5>
Once your needs and those of your loved ones have been met, you can help Parkinson Canada by donating Registered Assets such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF). There are significant tax savings for your estate when giving your Registered Assets.
<h5 id="annuity">4) Charitable Gift Annuity</h5>
A Charitable Gift Annuity allows you to support Parkinson Canada and in return you receive guaranteed income for life<em>.

<h5 id="remainder">5) Charitable Remainder Trust</h5>
You have an asset – perhaps stocks, bonds, securities, mutual funds or real estate – that you want to eventually donate to Parkinson Canada but you need the income it currently provides, or you may not wish to part with your asset at this time. A Charitable Remainder Trust is a way of giving by establishing a trust agreement between yourself and Parkinson Canada<em><u>.

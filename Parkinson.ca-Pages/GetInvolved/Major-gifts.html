<h4>National Research Program</h4>
Investing in research is one of the cornerstones of what we do at Parkinson Canada. Each year, the National Research Program funds grants, awards and fellowships for a number of scientists and medical researchers across Canada These projects help expand our knowledge and understanding of the causes, diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s and often serve as a stepping stone for larger research projects that will yield significant findings and new discoveries.

Parkinson Canada supports early research and new investigators. Many young scientists – funded by Parkinson Canada – have gone on to become important Parkinson’s researchers, encouraged by this early support.

Parkinson Canada funds investigator-driven discovery research, allowing researchers to be creative and try novel ideas, an approach that promotes discovery and breakthroughs. A further focus on clinical fellowships and new investigator awards, in addition to psychosocial research streams, gives physicians the opportunity to receive additional training and/or acquire specialized expertise in clinical aspects of Parkinson disease and other movement disorders. By providing funding to new investigators, the National Research Program creates a generation of committed Parkinson researchers and allows opportunities to investigate new ideas that other research programs may not support.

Investments in research by Parkinson Canada have generated many internationally acknowledged breakthroughs in the understanding of Parkinson’s disease.  Canada is a leader in Parkinson’s research and we must continue to invest in life-changing discoveries that bring us closer to a possible cure for this disease.

Since 1981, Parkinson Canada has invested more than $26 million in 503 research projects. As of September 2016, Parkinson Canada is proud to support 19 new grant, fellowships and student awards. These new awards represent a total of $1,124,018 committed to support new research projects in Canada over the next two years.

<h6>Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson’s Disease – 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition</h6>

In 2012, we published the first ever <em>Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson's Disease</em>. The information in this publication enabled medical professionals to get the most up-to-date information on symptoms, progress, treatment and self-management of the disease. This was a very important step in ensuring consistent, high level care for people with Parkinson’s across the country.

Our knowledge of Parkinson’s disease grows with each year. Great strides are being made to understand how we may help Canadian’s with Parkinson’s better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.

One of the projects we are currently working on is the development of the 2nd edition of The<em> Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson ’s Disease</em>. Parkinson’s disease is a complex neurological condition and each person’s experience is unique, from age of onset, to diagnosis, progression and treatment options to manage the many symptoms. The<em> Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson’s Disea</em>se, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, will provide health care professionals with recommendations that will guide their clinical practice on how to best manage the disease and improve the standard of care for individuals with Parkinson’s across Canada.

Dr. David Grimes MD, FRCPC (Director, Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Clinic, Associate Professor, Neurology, Ottawa Hospital, University of Ottawa) will be the lead author again on this publication. The intention of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition is to address the gap areas from the 1<sup>st</sup> Edition of the publication, such as the non-motor symptoms of the disease, as well as ensuring that other interdisciplinary professionals such as pharmacists and nurses are also aware and using the <em>Guidelines</em>.

The <em>Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson’s Disease</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, will require a total investment of $250,000 over a two year period. Partial funding is a welcomed option. The goal is to have the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition published and available by the end of 2017.

<h6>Recognition Opportunities</h6>

Parkinson Canada provides recognition opportunities in consultation with the funding donor.  Possible recognition includes shared named recognition for the duration on any grant, award or fellowship; acknowledgement of the funding source on publications; named recognition at Parkinson Canada event(s).  Such opportunities will be taken into consideration and included in the pledge or gift agreement.

<h4 id="stock-gifts">Gifts of Stocks &amp; Securities</h4>

A donation of publicly traded securities is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can support Parkinson Canada. And you can avoid the capital gains tax that you would normally have to pay if you sold the securities and then donated the proceeds. Parkinson Canada will issue you a charitable tax receipt for the fair market value of the security on the date of transfer into our brokerage account. You can donate securities now, or as part of your estate planning.

<!-- You can download the information page, the Guidelines for Transferring Assets, and the Letter of Authorization From Donor to Broker here. -->

How does it work?

Here’s an example of the benefits of donating stocks.

Consider a donor in the 46% tax bracket (assuming a provincial tax rate of 17%) who has already donated $200 this year to a charity (the first $200 of charitable donations attracts tax credits at a lower rate). Assume she donates stock worth $10,000, which is the current value of the shares with an adjusted cost base of $4,000.

<strong id="htm2">Q. Why should I choose Parkinson Canada as my Parkinson's charity? </strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Parkinson Canada is the only Canadian charity dedicated to providing support for people living with Parkinson’s disease every single day of the Parkinson’s journey. We provide education and support services and advocate on behalf of people living with Parkinson’s disease. As well Parkinson Canada’s Research Program funds research into the cause, prevention, improved treatment and/or understanding of Parkinson’s disease and related disorders including Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).

<strong id="htm6">Q. What is the most efficient way to donate to Parkinson Canada?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> An automatic debit or credit card monthly donation is the most efficient way to donate to Parkinson Canada. This method of giving keeps our fundraising costs down while ensuring that we have a regular source of income to fund ongoing projects and research. It's simple to set up and you can change or stop your donation at any time simply by <a href="http://www.parkinson.ca/about-us/contact-us/">contacting us</a>.

You may also wish to consider leaving <strong>a gift to Parkinson Canada in your Will</strong>. A considerable portion of our funding comes from people who leave a lasting legacy in this way. These gifts play an important role in how Parkinson Canada shapes programs and services.

<a href="#htmtop">TOP</a>

<strong id="htm7">Q. What is a corporate matching gift?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Many corporations have matching gift programs. When you make a donation to Parkinson Canada, your company will provide an equal or “matching” donation, thereby doubling your gift. It's an easy way to multiply the impact of your contribution to supporting people living with Parkinson’s disease. Talk to your employer to find out if your company has such a program and how you can participate.

<a href="#htmtop">TOP</a>

<strong id="htm8">Q. Will I receive a tax receipt for my donation?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Yes. All donations made by mail or phone will receive an official tax receipt for amounts of $20 or more. All donations made online will automatically be issued a receipt.
If your gift is less than $20 and you would like an official tax receipt, please let us know and we will be happy to send you one.

<a href="#htmtop">TOP</a>

<strong id="htm9">Q. When will I receive my tax receipt?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Parkinson Canada’s goal is to send receipts to our donors within two weeks of receiving a donation. For donors who have chosen to give each month through our pre-authorized monthly giving program, receipts are sent out once a year at the end of January. For Parkinson SuperWalk donations you will receive your receipt by the end of January. Receipts for online donations are automatically sent to the email address provided after the transaction is completed.

<a href="#htmtop">TOP</a>

<strong id="htm10">Q. Will Parkinson Canada sell or trade my name and address?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Parkinson Canada will not sell or trade your name and address if you let us know. We respect your privacy and do not sell personal information. To keep our fundraising costs low and to find new donors, we do occasionally trade donor names and addresses with other carefully selected organizations occasionally. However, if you request that we not trade your name and address, we will honour your request.

<strong id="htm11">Q. What if I do not want to receive correspondence from Parkinson Canada?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> We love to keep you informed about how your gift is being used to bring support and hope to people living with Parkinson’s.

<strong id="htm12">Q. Do I have any rights as a donor?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Yes, donors have many rights. Parkinson Canada has adopted <a href="https://afpglobal.org/donor-bill-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Donor Bill of Rights</a> (PDF) that was developed by the Association of Fundraising Professionals. At Parkinson Canada, we believe that current and prospective donors should have full confidence in the causes they are asked to support.

<strong id="htm16">Q. Parkinson Canada received accreditation under Imagine Canada's national Standards Program. Why is this important and what does it mean for me?</strong>

<strong>A. </strong>The Standards Program is a Canada-wide set of shared standards for charities and nonprofits to demonstrate their compliance in five fundamental areas: board governance; financial accountability and transparency; fundraising; staff management; and volunteer involvement. It helps organizations mitigate risk by ensuring that staff and volunteers understand and meet their legal, financial and fiduciary responsibilities. Parkinson Canada is one of over 200 organizations in Canada to obtain this highest accreditation standard.

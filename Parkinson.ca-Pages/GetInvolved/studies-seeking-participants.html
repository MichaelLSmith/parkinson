<p style="text-align: right;">February 2018</p>
<p> You are invited to participate in a study entitled “Family Perspectives on Assisted Dying.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Who we are:</u></strong><u><br /> </u>We are a team of four researchers from the University of Toronto – two are student occupational therapists and two are professors at the university.<br /> <u><br /> <strong>Why we are doing this:</strong><br /> </u>Assisted dying is now an option for individuals eligible in Canada. The change in the law is intended to offer more options, but it may also make some people feel more concerned. There are checks and balances in place to try to prevent any improper use of assisted dying and to promote informed decisions made by the individual who is considering assisted dying. <br /> <br /> While some researchers have examined family members' support of assisted dying, we know very little about the attitudes and perspectives of family members regarding this issue and no research has been conducted to date in Canada. The purpose of this study is to gain further insight into the attitudes, perspectives and experiences of family members now that assisted dying is a legal option.<br /> <br /> The findings of this study will contribute to recommendations for supporting both patients and their family members during the dying process.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who we are asking:</u></strong><u><br /> </u>We are asking family members (including close personal friends) who are or who have been involved in the care of individuals with a grievous and irremediable condition to participate in this study. The care recipient must be or have been eligible for health services in Canada. The care recipient does not or did not need to be eligible for assisted dying under the current law in Canada. </p>
<p><strong><u>What we are asking:</u></strong><u><br /> </u>This study asks for your thoughts on the how the legalization of assisted dying affects:<br /> 1) Your role in the care of someone who may or may not be considering a legal request for assisted dying;<br /> 2) The impact of this role on your health and well-being;<br /> 3) Your potential needs for support from the healthcare and social systems.<br /> <br /> We will also be asking some general information about you (for example, age and education), but we will not be asking for information that can identify you. </p>
<p><strong><u>How we’re asking:</u></strong><br /> We will be asking you to complete a telephone interview for this study by May 2018. We will need to arrange to contact you for the interview, but will delete your contact details once it is complete. We will record the interview anonymously- without any identifying details- so that we can transcribe it. We will ask you at the end of the interview if you still feel or wish your responses to be included – you can then ask to have it deleted if you wish for any reason.</p>
<p>The interview recording will be kept for transcription and then deleted. As we will not have any way to identify each recording, or the transcripts, there will be no way to delete it once it is added to the other responses. Any potentially identifying details will be de-identified or removed.</p>
<p>You also have the option to complete an online survey in place of the telephone interview. We are using a survey system called Survey Monkey. The survey asks for no identifying information from you – only some general demographics. We ask that you take care not to include any identifying details in the open comments sections. If any identifying details are included, we will omit them from any reports/publications/ presentations about this study.</p>
<p>The survey will be open until the end of May 2018. If you wish to withdraw from the survey once you have started it, you can simply click 'discard' at any time - this will remove any responses you have entered. Once you click 'submit', your responses cannot be removed.  </p>

<h4>Evaluation of Parkinson’s disease questionnaire used by speech pathologists</h4>
The University of Sydney in Australia is conducting an online survey of Registered Occupational Therapists to examine the perceived knowledge, attitudes, behaviours, and barriers of occupational therapists regarding the use of psychological strategies in their practice with clients living with Parkinson’s disease.

This study involves the evaluation of a disease-specific questionnaire that assesses the physical and social effects of PD on speech, swallowing, communication. Determining the appropriateness and accuracy of this questionnaire will help health professionals to better understand the needs of persons with PD in order to provide appropriate care and support.

All potential participants will be invited to go to the questionnaire’s website. Upon opening the website, the participant will be asked to read a <em>Participation Information Statement</em> and to provide consent to proceed with the questionnaire. The questionnaire will take approximately 25 to 30 minutes to complete. The information gathered will be used to evaluate the appropriateness and accuracy of the questionnaire.

If the participant leaves their email address, we will contact them after 2 weeks and will ask them to complete a shorter questionnaire with fewer questions. This will take them approximately 10 minutes to complete.

While the study is primarily being conducted in Australia, the validation of the questionnaire is for a general English-speaking population. The study's aim is on improving healthcare services and providing better resources for assessing Speech and communication symptom severity in Parkinson's patients in Australia, but we hope to generalize this improvement for patients across English-speaking countries.

<h4>Toronto Western Hospital looking into the build-up of iron in the brains of people with Parkinson’s</h4>
Researchers at Toronto Western Hospital are looking for participants for the SKY study (Study of Parkinson’s Early Stage). They are taking a new approach to treating Parkinson’s disease by looking at the build-up of iron in certain regions of the brain among people with Parkinson’s disease. It is not known whether this build-up of iron is causing harm to the brain cells, or whether removing it may improve the motor symptoms of this disease or slow its progress. The SKY clinical study aims to address these questions.

<h4>Biomedical technology for individuals with Parkinson’s disease</h4>
Researchers at Simon Fraser University are inviting people with Parkinson’s disease to participate in a research study to examine the effect of Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) on gait.GVS is a process of sending specific electric messages to a nerve in the ear, by placing non-invasive electrodes behind the ear.Electroencephalography (EEG), Electromyography (EMG), accelerometry, and simulated walking environment system will be used for data collection.

<h4>Understanding the neural correlates of steering of gait in Parkinson’s disease with freezing of gait</h4>
Researchers in the dept. of Kinesiology at McGill University are conducting a study to determine the effects of Parkinson’s disease with, and without, freezing of gait on the activation of the brain regions involved in turning and changing direction while walking.

Participants would need to make three, two-hour visits to the lab located beside the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University (downtown campus) at 475 Avenue Des Pins (parking available.) You will be asked to complete two different walking exercises in combination with brain imaging.

Requirements include:
<ul>
 	<li>Person with Parkinson’s disease</li>
 	<li>Able to walk independently (without use of walking aid) for 40 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examining the Prevalence and Associations of Health and Mobility in Canadians</h4>
Here is a chance to participate in a study funded by the University of Waterloo International Research and Partnership Grant to examine the effects of health on mobility among Canadians.  The aim is to determine how health as well as physical, cognitive and social factors influence injury rates including driving and fall related accidents. Findings from this project will lead to program and service development that address the needs of Canadians as they age. Follow up studies will be done in 5 year intervals to see how health, mobility, driving practices, the environment, activity levels and cognitive function have changed.  Comparing data every 5 years will result in greater understanding of health and mobility trends among an aging population. For additional insight findings from this study will be compared to residents of France, who have completed the same survey.

Requirements include:
<ul>
 	<li>Over 45 years of age</li>
 	<li>Complete a 90 question online survey about your health, attitudes and behaviours, mobility, social demographic factors, driving, falls and a few questions on memory, sleepiness and distraction</li>
</ul>

<p>This presentation focuses on what music therapy is, and how it can help improve speech production, motor  movements such as upper arm/hand movement and gait, as well as what role it plays in improving mood, and decreasing stress.  It will also highlight some of the newest research in the field as well as a fun interactive musical activity.</p>

<h6>Dr. Joseph DeSouza</h6>

<p>Dr. DeSouza is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology &amp; Graduate programs in Biology, Interdisciplinary Studies and Neuroscience Graduate Diploma Program at York University&rsquo;s Centre for Vision Research.</p>
<p>He received his PhD in Neuroscience at the University of Western Ontario in 2001, which was followed by postdoctoral training at the Robarts Research Institute and the Centre for Vision Research. Since 2006, his lab (www.joeLAB.com) focuses on how multisensory signals are attended and/or suppressed depending on the appropriate behavioural context and how the next decision is chosen through improvised or trained motor movements (eye, hand, body and/or dance).</p>
<p>His lab's translational research with people with Parkinson's Disease, people with depression and chronic pain and Problem Gamblers aims to show how and where in brain networks change as a function of neurorehabilitation.</p>
<p>His lifelong pursuit will be to ease the burden of disease and to find neuroimaging biomarkers through computational modelling.</p>

Dr. Fahn receives this honour for his outstanding international leadership and contribution to the field of Parkinson’s research. Dr. Fahn is the Scientific Director of the (American) Parkinson’s Disease Foundation and Past President of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

Dr Fahn continues to be active in patient care, research, and teaching and has trained over 120 movement disorder fellows, including many who are professors of neurology around the globe. Dr. Fahn is the recipient of numerous honours and awards for outstanding clinical research. Among his many accomplishments are his organization and execution of the development of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to determine the severity of Parkinson’s disease, and the modification and popularization of the use of the Schwab England ADL which measures quality of life.

He served as chair and organizer of the first World Parkinson Congress held in Washington, DC, in 2006, co-organized the second World Parkinson Congress, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2010 and will co-chair the third World Parkinson Congress in Montreal, Canada, in 2013.

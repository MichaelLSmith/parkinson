	<h5 id="overview">Leading the way in Parkinson’s research</h5>
	Since 1981, the Parkinson Canada Research Program has invested more than $26 million in funding for:
	<ul>
		 <li>High-quality, innovative Canadian research by established and promising investigators.</li>
		 <li>Discovery stage research where investigators test new theories and pursue promising new leads.</li>
		 <li>Researchers at the beginning of their careers in order to foster the next generation of Parkinson’s scientists.</li>
		 <li>Novel research to build greater capacity, promote creativity and engage more researchers.</li>
		 <li>More than 503 awards, fellowships, and grants that teach us more about diagnosing and treating Parkinson’s disease.</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Research Funding</strong>
	
	Financial support from individuals, corporations and foundations makes the Parkinson Canada Research Program possible. Funding for the Parkinson Canada Research Program is provided by Parkinson Canada, our regional partners and our research partners across the country.
	
	<strong>Finding better treatments</strong> to learn more about the causes, progression, and complications of Parkinson’s.
	
	Improving quality of life for people with Parkinson’s and their families so they can live their lives to the fullest, despite the challenges of this disease. This area of research spans a variety of health disciplines such as nursing, occupational therapy, speech language pathology and social work.
	
	<strong>Building capacity</strong> among the next generation of Canadian researchers. We also fund specialized training for doctors in the diagnosis and management of the disease and other movement disorders so there will be more Parkinson’s specialists to provide high quality care.
	
	<strong>Contributing on an international scale</strong> to the collective understanding of this complex disease and to the global search for a cure. Continued investments in research will produce more life-changing discoveries and bring us closer to a world without Parkinson’s disease.
	
	<strong>Related Disorders</strong>, such as Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and other Parkinson’s conditions, are also funded by the Parkinson Canada Research Program.
	<h5 id="advisory">Scientific Advisory Board</h5>
	The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) is a volunteer panel of experts which reviews funding applications to determine scientific excellence and relevance to Parkinson’s disease, providing the highest quality of objective adjudication.

	<h5 id="committee">Research Policy Committee</h5>
	The Research Policy Committee (RPC) provides funding allocation recommendations to the Parkinson Canada Board of Directors. The RPC also advises the Board on policies about the most effective means to promote research into the cause(s), management and eventual cure of Parkinson’s disease.
	
	The Research Policy Committee (RPC) and Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) are two separate volunteer committees. The chair of the SAB also serves on the RPC to ensure continuity.

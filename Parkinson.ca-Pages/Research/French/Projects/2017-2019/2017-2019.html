Pierre-Alexandre Bourgouin, PhD student
Université du Québec à Montréal
Graduate Student Award
$35,000 over 2 years

At the Université du Québec à Montréal, PhD candidate Pierre-Alexandre Bourgouin studies the connection between a sleep disorder called idiopathic REM behaviour disorder and Parkinson’s disease. Bourgouin, a neuropsychologist, uses an imaging technology to search for changes in the white matter in the brains of people with this disorder, which can cause them to be violent during REM sleep. Since 80 percent of those people later develop Parkinson’s, he hopes to discover differences in their white matter – the connections between cells. Those differences could provide clues to how Parkinson’s develops.

Dr. Johannes Frasnelli, Professor
University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières
Pilot Project Grant
$40,000 over 1 year

At the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières, Dr. Johannes Frasnelli is studying a sensory system most people don’t even know they have. He’s investigating the trigeminal chemosensory system, which allows us to detect spiciness, freshness and burning sensations, to see if the system remains intact in people with Parkinson’s disease when they lose their sense of smell. If it does, it could become an important tool for detecting who is at risk of Parkinson’s.

Pilot Project
$45,000 over 1 year

At the University of Toronto, Dr. Antonio Strafella conducts imaging studies on the brains of people with Parkinson’s disease. He’s using a new tracer, or chemical, that can highlight changes in the brain that show up on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. Strafella is studying the density of the synapses, or connections, in brain cells to see if a reduction in that density, measured over time, could serve as a non-invasive tool to diagnose Parkinson’s disease or differentiate between different types of the condition.

Dr. Thomas Durcan, Assistant Professor
Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University
New Investigator Award
$90,000 over 2 years

At the Montreal Neurological Institute, neuroscientist Thomas Durcan studies the mechanisms within the human brain that can be exploited to protect it from the impact of Parkinson’s disease. This work focuses on a protein called Parkin, which removes damaged components from cells, as well as a partner enzyme that appears to guide this protein’s activities. He suggests that this enzyme could be a worthwhile target for new drugs or other therapies that could enhance Parkin’s ability to protect against the effects of Parkinson’s.

Jordan Follett, Post-Doctoral Fellow
University of British Columbia
Funded by Parkinson Society British Columbia
Basic Research Fellowship
$80,000 over 2 years

At the University of British Columbia, neuroscientist Jordan Follett is investigating the role of the retromer complex, a sorting network within brain cells that may position particular RNA-binding proteins within cells. Follett’s working theory is that if genes within the retromer complex are mutated, they could be misplacing the RNA within dopamine-producing cells, ultimately causing them to die. If he can validate his theory, it could lead to new avenues for drug discovery.

Pilot Project Grant
$45,000 over 2 years

Jean-François Trempe, an assistant professor at McGill University’s Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, is studying a gene that normally assesses the health of cells and signals when unhealthy ones should be eliminated. This regulatory mechanism appears to be distorted in cells affected by Parkinson’s disease. If this gene’s behaviour could be stabilized, the brain cells’ built-in system for keeping themselves healthy might be restored.

New medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease can be blessings for people who no longer respond to levodopa, the most commonly prescribed medication for this condition. But a side-effect of this new class of medications can be impulsivity, leading to excessive gambling or other harmful problems. At the University of British Columbia, Melanie Tremblay investigates the underlying mechanisms in the brain that make people vulnerable to this side-effect, to see if researchers could reverse the problem or develop another drug to treat it.

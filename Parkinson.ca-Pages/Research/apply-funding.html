</strong>Submit your application noting that the ethical review is pending and forward the approval as soon as it is available (preferably before adjudication). If your application is approved by Parkinson Canada, you will receive funding upon receipt of copies of the approval by the Ethics Board.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>S</strong><strong>ignatures</strong></em>

<strong>W</strong><strong>ha</strong><strong>t is the policy regarding signatures for applications? </strong>

<strong><u>A</u></strong><strong><u>pplications must be submitted with the required signatures by the noted due date</u> . </strong>Prior to submission, applicants should determine what signatures are needed. Print the applicant information sheet (face sheet) and obtain <strong> <u>all the required signatures</u> </strong>for the application. Once obtained, scan the signature page and upload the signed signature page to the Parkinson Canada online research application system as part of your submission.

<strong>W</strong><strong>her</strong><strong>e do I find the face sheet to obtain signatures?
</strong>The face sheet/signature page is generated by the online research application system by printing the personal information section of the applicant checklist.

<strong>W</strong><strong>ha</strong><strong>t signatures do I need for my application?
</strong>All candidates must have their application signed by an <u>authorized signing official</u> of the applicant’s research institution (primary location of research). Applicants should check with their research awards office to determine who has authority to endorse their application.

Depending on the type of application, signatures are required from co-applicants (not collaborators) and supervisors. Please see the appropriate Request For Application document.

<strong>W</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o is an appropriate signing official?
</strong>An individual who has the authority to bind the institute or organization where the research will take place is an appropriate signing official.

<strong>Doe</strong><strong>s the signature page (face sheet) need to be couriered to Parkinson Canada in addition to the online submission?
</strong>No, a single PDF of the signature page (face sheet) containing all required signatures should be uploaded through the online application system.

Applicants do not need to courier any documents to Parkinson Canada; however, we ask that you keep the original signed documents which may be requested in the event that your application is successful in the competition.

<em><strong>Letters of reference/support</strong></em>

<strong>If the supporting letter from my sponsor(s) will not be available by the deadline for submissions, will this make my application ineligible?
</strong>Letters of support that are not received by the deadline may not be included with the application for review. Where necessary, exceptions may be explicitly arranged with our office.

<strong>Ho</strong><strong>w many letters of support should I provide with my application?
</strong>Three letters of support are required with each application.

<strong>Doe</strong><strong>s a supervisor qualify as one of the three sponsors needed to fill out assessment forms?
</strong>Yes, a supervisor can be a sponsor providing that the supervisor clearly indicates that they would be the applicant’s supervisor and therefore have some conflict of interest in the proposal.

<strong>W</strong><strong>ha</strong><strong>t information should be included in a letter of support for a student?
</strong>Letters of reference/ support should highlight the applicant’s strengths as they relate to suitability/experience in research (e.g. originality, technical ability, demonstrated skills, judgment, critical skills, etc.).

For international candidates, sponsors are encouraged to comment on the grades and/or class ranking of the candidate within the content of their letters.

<em><strong>Transcripts</strong></em>

<strong>Ar</strong><strong>e there special requirements for international transcripts?
</strong>Yes, international transcripts <strong>MUST </strong>be accompanied by a certified English or French interpretation and a clear explanation of the grading system. International candidates are encouraged to obtain official conversions of their grades to GPA by their institute.

<strong>W</strong><strong>ill you accept transcripts from my personal university account?
</strong>No, transcripts printed from the candidate’s personal university account are not considered to be official.

<strong>D</strong><strong>o my transcripts need to be sent directly from my institute to be considered official?
</strong>No, Parkinson Canada considers transcripts issued by the Registrar ’s Office to the student to be official transcripts. Opening the envelope to scan the transcript will not render it unofficial for Parkinson Canada’s purposes.

<strong>Ho</strong><strong>w should transcripts be submitted for my application?
</strong>Official transcripts must be provided by scanning both sides of each page and uploading them in reverse chronological order, from least recent to most recent as a single PDF document.

<em><strong>Funding decisions</strong></em>

<strong>Ho</strong><strong>w are funding decisions made?
</strong>Applications are peer reviewed and adjudicated by the Scientific Advisory Council (SAC). Following the adjudication meeting for each application cycle, Parkinson Canada’s Research Policy Committee reviews the rank order of applications and makes recommendations for funding to Parkinson Canada’s Board of Directors.

<strong>Ho</strong><strong>w do I know if my application was successful?</strong>

Dependent on the competition cycle, applicants are notified of the result of their application in June. Public announcements of competition results are made in September.

<strong>Doe</strong><strong>s Parkinson Canada release comments or scoring from reviewers after the adjudication so that I can improve my project in future?
</strong>The Scientific Advisory Council anticipates that it will provide each applicant whose application to participate in the Program has been declined with written notice of such decision. Grant applicants will receive anonymized copies of the reviews for their applications, and where possible, a brief written critique of their application. All applicants will be provided with their ranking in the competition and the average score received during the review of their application.

<em><strong>For Research Program award recipients</strong></em>

<strong>W</strong><strong>ha</strong><strong>t responsibilities do I have as a Parkinson Canada award recipient?
</strong>See Guidelines.

<strong>Ca</strong><strong>n signed contracts be e-mailed back?
</strong>Yes.

<strong>Ca</strong><strong>n salary support for a fellow be paid directly to the fellow?
</strong>Unless the fellow is training abroad, an academic health sciences centre research office should administer the award. In the case of international fellowships, arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis.

<strong>Cou</strong><strong>ld my funding be discontinued after one year?
</strong>Yes, although this is rare. Continuation of support for a second year is contingent upon receipt of a progress report deemed satisfactory by scientific review, as outlined in the Guidelines.

<strong>D</strong><strong>o you have a policy regarding leaves of absence and/or parental leave?
</strong>Yes, please see Guidelines section VI subsections (e) Prolonged Absence from Work and/or (f) Parental Leave.

The safety, health and well-being of our Parkinson community across Canada are of utmost importance to Parkinson Canada and we continue to monitor developments.

During this global outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as Corona Virus), we are implementing proactive ways to help manage the risk and reduce potential spread of this disease to those most vulnerable.

	Until further notice, <strong>in-person support group meetings</strong> will not be held. We will make alternate arrangements using telephone/technology to provide information and support. Please contact your local support group leader or <a href="https://www.parkinson.ca/programs-near-you/">visit this webpage</a> for more information and updates about events near you.  Additional decisions to cancel public meetings and events may be posted, as we evaluate the risks for you and our community.

<strong>Here are some actions we recommend for you and others living with Parkinson's disease:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Check your medications</strong>. Take inventory and reorder any that are running low.</li>
 	<li><strong>Talk to your doctor about the pneumonia vaccine</strong>. Seniors (60+) are most at risk to develop COVID-19 symptoms that can lead to the development of pneumonia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Review Parkinson Canada’s </strong><a href="https://www.parkinson.ca/resources/act-on-time/">ACT on Time™ program</a> and resources in the event you need to educate a health care professional about your Parkinson’s needs. If you become hospitalized, refer to the resource about <a href="https://www.parkinson.ca/wp-content/uploads/Managing-My-Parkinsons-Disease-in-Healthcare-Settings.pdf">Managing Parkinson’s Disease in Healthcare Settings</a></li>

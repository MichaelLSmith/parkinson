Due to renovations at our main office location, <span class="park-red-text">Parkinson Canada telephone and email systems will not be operating between the hours of <strong>6 p.m.</strong> Eastern Time on <strong>Friday, December 21, 2018</strong> through <strong>6 a.m. on Monday, December 24, 2018</strong></span>. This will affect anyone attempting to reach us outside of our normal business hours (9am – 5pm EST, Monday through Friday).

<h5 class="park-red-text">What to expect:</h5>

If you send an email to any address ending in @parkinson.ca, it will be held in the queue until the system is restored when power is reconnected.

If you call any Parkinson Canada telephone number (extension or direct line), or send a fax to us, the phone will ring and voice mail will not be operational. Telephone access will resume when power is restored at the main office location.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

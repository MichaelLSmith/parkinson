<strong>Loss of sense of smell:</strong> Research has indicated that 90% of people with Parkinson’s have lost their sense of smell

<strong>Affects both young and old:</strong> The average age of onset is 60, but Parkinson’s can affect people as young as 30 or 40 (<a href="http://www.parkinson.ca/site/lookup.asp?c=kgLNIWODKpF&amp;b=5819037" target="_self">Young Onset</a>)

<strong>Depression:</strong> Feeling sad, having less energy or losing interest in activities are common symptoms of Parkinson’s

<strong>Shaking or tremors:</strong> One of the most common symptoms of Parkinson’s. Dr. James Parkinson, who discovered the illness in 1817, called it the “<a href="http://www.parkinson.ca/site/lookup.asp?c=kgLNIWODKpF&amp;b=3536133" target="_self">Shaking Palsy</a>”

<strong>Changes in thinking ability:</strong> Parkinson’s can affect one’s concentration, abstract thinking, judgment and memory

<strong>Slow movement:</strong> Movement is normally controlled by a chemical called dopamine which carries signals between the nerves in our brain. When cells that produce dopamine die, we move slowly.

<strong>Soft speech:</strong> Muscles that control speech can also be affected in Parkinson’s. This makes communication difficult. Speech therapy can help through exercises such as purposely speaking loudly.

<strong>Muscle stiffness and rigidity:</strong> Two common symptoms in Parkinson’s. Exercise can maintain and improve muscle strength in order to carry out daily activities.

<strong>Stooped posture:</strong> One of the first noticeable changes in Parkinson’s. Specific exercises can be done to reduce or prevent changes in posture

<strong>Small handwriting:</strong> For some people with Parkinson’s, handwriting becomes increasingly smaller and often illegible. Exaggerating the range of movement in the hand can help.

<strong>Difficulty with walking and balance:</strong> Regular activity and exercise can improve balance, reducing risk for falls.

<strong>Over 100,000 Canadians affected:</strong> Parkinson’s affects men and women from all ethnic backgrounds. As the population ages, it is expected that the numbers will increase.

<strong>Researchers are seeking a cure:</strong> Parkinson Canada understands the importance of investing in Canada’s talented researchers. Since 1981, we have invested over $16.8 million in Parkinson’s <a href="http://parkinsonca.thedev.ca/research/" target="_self">research</a>, granting over 335 grants, fellowships and graduate awards. Parkinson Canada supports research that improves the quality of life of people living with Parkinson’s and focuses on finding the causes and a cure.

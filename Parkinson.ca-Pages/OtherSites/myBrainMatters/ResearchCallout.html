<blockquote>NHCC is now carrying out an assessment of the knowledge, program and implementation gaps that were identified in Mapping Connections, the report from Canadaâ€™s first-ever population health study of neurological conditions.

A number of troubling gaps were identified. Supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, our goal now is to explore whether and how, in the intervening four years, these gaps have widened, narrowed, or remain unchanged. We will report on our findings later this year.

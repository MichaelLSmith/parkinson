<p>PSP and Multiple system atrophy are neurodegenerative disorders that can mimic Parkinson’s disease in the early stages but have their own unique 	  features. In this presentation we will review the relationships between these disorders, the main signs and symptoms, and treatment options. Current research strategies will also be reviewed, and the hope for the future.</p>

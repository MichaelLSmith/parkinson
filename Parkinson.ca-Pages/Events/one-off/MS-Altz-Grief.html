Grief is not just experienced after a death; those of us with life-altering and life-limiting conditions often live with grief that is not recognized or understood by others, including health care professionals.

This grief is another factor that can separate us from our communities. It may last for a life-time, years, months or days prior to any death.

This webinar will explore the concept of how grief can be part of our ongoing lives that may begin at diagnosis or the first presentation of symptoms and continues to death and beyond, along with strategies to incorporate this grief into our lives and to use it to thrive. 

See event details below for more information about the date, time and registration.

Seven months prior to Isabelle's death, Karuna recognized subtle cues that indicated that Isabelle was entering the final phase of her life and organized, educated and managed a 17 member Tenderness Team to provide 24 hour love, care, compassion and support for Isabelle until she died.  Through this journey Karuna evolved from daughter to manager, advocate and sister to Isabelle while living with anticipatory and ambiguous grief and the multiple losses, changes, challenges and uncertainties that accompany all life altering conditions.

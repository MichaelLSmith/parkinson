<p>It is never too late to move forward, change your approach, and begin a neuroprotective therapy to improve well-being.  Research evidence demonstrates that movement and exercise can have meaningful biological, psychological, and social benefits for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Join us to learn more:</p>

	<p>You will have opportunities to observe and participate in demonstrations of neuroplasticity-principled approaches to benefit people living with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
	<p>Health care professionals will gain knowledge to apply in your practice to successfully address the needs of the whole patient to optimize function and improve lives.</p>
	<p>Keynote presenter Dr. Jon Doan will explore current research about exercise and movement as neurotherapy. Dr. Doan&rsquo;s discussion covers the likely mechanisms, motor and non-motor effects, and how this translates to activities of daily living and quality of life.</p>

				<dd class="close-margin">A growing body of research strongly suggests movement and exercise can have meaningful biological, psychological, and social benefits for people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD).  This talk will look at current research evidence for exercise and movement as PD neurotherapy, with discussion of the likely mechanisms, the motor and non-motor effects, and the logical translations to activities of daily living and quality of life for people living with Parkinson’s disease.</dd>

					<p>For persons living with Parkinson’s, a disease-specific approach to exercise is medically necessary to improve the quality of their life. Presenters will identify key principles that drive movement-induced neuroplasticity, demonstrate how these principles can be integrated into Parkinson’s-specific treatment protocols, and discuss motor, cognitive, and autonomic outcomes from diverse exercise programs for people with Parkinson’s disease.</p> 

					<p>Conference attendees will have opportunities to observe and participate in demonstrations of programs that offer neuroplasticity-principled approaches to people affected by Parkinson’s disease. Health care professionals will be able to successfully address the needs of the whole patient to optimize function and improve lives. People affected by PD will learn it is never too late to move forward, change their approach, and begin a neuroprotective therapy to improve their well-being.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.2em; color: #d50032;">Hi Ambassadors,</h2>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This week the federal government announced the budget. As you know the election is planned for October 21, 2019, making this a
“pre-election budget”. With a pre-election budget the government sets out to target their voter demographics and make good on promises from the 2015 election campaign, as seen with their targets for millennial housing and a focus on the indigenous population.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thank you to all of our Ambassadors who have been advocating with local officials to fund the Canadian Parkinson Network (newly renamed the Canadian Open Parkinson Network or C-OPN). The initiative is moving forward and we are optimistic about a government
partnership in the future.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The C-OPN initiative is in a stronger position now and will continue to improve with the first phase getting underway
with funding provided in partnership between <a style="font-size: 12pt;" href="https://braincanada.ca/news/canadian-open-parkinson-network-funding-begins-collaboration-platform-to-accelerate-parkinsons-disease-research-and-knowledge/">Parkinson Canada and Brain Canada</a>, development of a website, and public launch anticipated for this coming fall. The timelines for the initiative are based on the current
partnership with Brain Canada* and what is most effective for the establishment of the Network in this first phase.  We have an opportunity to fine-tune
the ‘ask’ and develop champions and spokespeople moving forward. Updated resources coming soon.</span>
</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are some highlights of interest from the budget:</strong></span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Budget 2019 proposes to make additional investments in support of the following organizations (ones of greatest relevance listed below), which signals a leveraging opportunity (pending the federal election results) for an investment into the C-OPN.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Stem Cell Network: </strong>Stem cell research—pioneered by two Canadians in the 1960s—holds great promise for new therapies and medical treatments for respiratory and heart diseases, spinal cord injury, cancer, and many other diseases and disorders. The Stem Cell Network is a national not-for-profit organization that helps translate stem cell research into clinical applications and commercial products. To support this important work and foster Canada’s leadership in stem cell research, Budget 2019 proposes to provide the Stem Cell Network with renewed funding of $18 million over three years, starting in 2019-20.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">*Brain Canada Foundation: </strong>The Brain Canada Foundation is a national charitable organization that raises funds to foster advances in neuroscience discovery research, with the aim of improving health care for people affected by neurological injury and disease. To help the medical community better understand the brain and brain health, Budget 2019 proposes to provide the Brain Canada Foundation’s Canada Brain Research Fund with up to $40 million over two years, starting in 2020-21. This investment will be matched by funds raised from other non-government partners of the Brain Canada Foundation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Genome Canada: </strong>The insights derived from genomics—the study of the entire genetic information of living things encoded in their DNA and related molecules and proteins—hold the potential for breakthroughs that can improve the lives of Canadians and drive innovation and economic growth. Genome Canada is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to advancing genomics science and technology in order to create economic and social benefits for Canadians. To support Genome Canada’s operations, Budget 2019 proposes to provide Genome Canada with $100.5 million over five years, starting in 2020-21. This investment will also enable Genome Canada to launch new large-scale research competitions and projects, in collaboration with external partners, ensuring that Canada’s research community continues to have access to the resources needed to make transformative
scientific breakthroughs and translate these discoveries into real-world applications.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Budget 2019 outlines steps toward implementing <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">national pharmacare</strong>.
Specifically, the federal government proposes to provide Health Canada with $35 million over four years, starting in 2019-20 to establish a Canadian Drug
Agency Transition Office.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Budget 2019 also proposes to invest up to $1 billion over two years, starting in 2022-23, with up to $500
million per year ongoing, to help Canadians with<strong style="font-size: 12pt;"> rare diseases</strong> access the drugs they require.</span></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
		<strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Modernizing the regulation of clinical trials</strong> : Industry and academics have expressed concerns that regulations related to clinical trials are overly prescriptive and inconsistent. Health Canada proposes to implement a risk-based approach to clinical trials to reduce costs to industry and academics by removing unnecessary requirements for low-risk drugs and trials. The regulations will also provide the agri-food industry with the ability to carry out clinical trials within Canada on products such as food for special dietary use and novel foods.
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
		<strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Better home care and mental health</strong>: These priorities are outlined in the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities between federal, provincial and territorial health ministers. The Government is working with jurisdictions to establish bilateral agreements that will set out how individual jurisdictions will use federal funding to improve access to home care and mental health services.
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Building on this investment, and in support of the <strong style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>National Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias Act</em></strong>, Budget 2019 proposes to provide<em style="font-size: 12pt;"> </em>the Public Health Agency of Canada with $50 million over five years, starting in<em style="font-size: 12pt;"> </em>2019-20, to support the implementation of Canada’s first National Dementia<em style="font-size: 12pt;"> </em>Strategy, which is expected to be publicly released this spring.
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Working with key stakeholders, including the provinces and territories, this funding will help improve the quality of life of people living with dementia, and their caregivers, by:</span>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Increasing awareness about dementia through targeted campaigns and activities that focus on prevention, as well as reducing risk and stigma.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Developing treatment guidelines and best practices for early diagnosis.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Improving our understanding of the prevalence and effects of dementia on our communities.</span>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Expanding the list of <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">GST/HST-exempt health care services</strong> to specifically include a multidisciplinary health care service, such as when a physician, occupational therapist and physiotherapist combine their expertise and work together as a team to provide a rehabilitation service.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Government will work with stakeholders and Canadians with disabilities to create new <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">accessibility standards and regulations</strong> that will apply to these sectors, which include banking, telecommunications, transportation, and the Government of Canada itself:</span>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Act also includes compliance and enforcement measures that will proactively address accessibility barriers in the federal jurisdiction, alleviating the burden on Canadians with disabilities to resort to a formal complaints process.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Along with the new legislation, the Government announced an investment of $290 million over six years, starting in 2018-19, to implement the Act, ensure that the federal government leads in accessibility improvements, and promote broader inclusion of persons with disabilities beyond the federal jurisdiction.</span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)</strong> top-up payment by up to $947 per year for single seniors boosted benefits for nearly 900,000 low-income seniors, while restoring the eligibility age for Old Age Security and GIS benefits to 65 means thousands of dollars more for Canadians as they become seniors.</span>
</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;">To improve seniors’ quality of life, and to better promote seniors’ participation and inclusion in their communities, Budget 2019 proposes to provide additional funding of $100 million over five years, with $20 million per year ongoing, for the <strong style="font-size: 12pt;">New Horizons for Seniors Program</strong></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt;">More protections and better security for seniors/pensions </strong> enhancing the Guaranteed Income Supplement through reform of exemptions, greater CPP flexibility, and a new National Pension Hub to support pension research focused on improving retirement savings outcomes for Canadians and developing solutions to pension challenges.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong style="font-size: 12pt; color: #d50032;">We would like to hear from you. What are your thoughts on the budget?</strong></span>
</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jacquie Micallef & Kayla Lauzon</span></p>

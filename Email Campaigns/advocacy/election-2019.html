							<p style="font-size: 15pt;">
								The time has finally arrived. Today the Federal Election was officially called, which means there are 5&frac12; weeks to meet with candidates in your communities and raise their awareness of Parkinson’s disease.
							</p>

							<p style="font-size: 15pt;">
								An election hub is available on Parkinson Canada’s website. The hub includes the infographic and toolkit that you received last week. There is also a petition available on the site to help boost engagement on advocacy issues. The hub is available at: <a href="https://www.parkinson.ca/getinvolved/current-priorities/">https://www.parkinson.ca/getinvolved/current-priorities/</a>

<h2><strong>Canadians urgently need action on brain health</strong></h2>
Brain conditions – brain illnesses, disorders and injuries – are one of the leading causes of disability in Canada and, indeed, worldwide. One in three Canadians (10 million) will have a brain condition in their lifetime – whether from birth, early childhood, young adulthood, middle age or as seniors.

NHCC urges all political parties and candidates to support action on brain health now.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Recommendation #1:  </strong>Create a Canadian Brain Council to lead unprecedented collaboration throughout the brain health community;</li>
 	<li><strong>Recommendation #2:  </strong>Support Canadians living with brain conditions, families and caregivers;</li>
 	<li><strong>Recommendation #3:  </strong>Test a new model of integrated health and support care services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>NHCC stresses importance of brain conditions in proposed accessibility legislation</h2>
Brain conditions are the largest cause of disability worldwide with one in three Canadians affected by a brain or nervous system illness, disorder or injury, including mental health conditions, within their lifetimes.  In its recommendations for changes to the proposed federal Accessibility Act, NHCC stressed the importance of  flexibility to ensure benefit for people living with brain conditions.  See all NHCC recommendations and full submission<a href="http://mybrainmatters.ca/wp-content/uploads/NHCC-InputBillC81FinalOct.18-2018.pdf"> here</a>.
<h2><strong>Federal budget 2018 – NHCC analysis</strong></h2>
NHCC is pleased that <strong>two issues for which we have been advocating were part of the federal government’s commitments in the 2018 budget tabled February 27.</strong> The first is a major investment in science and research. The second is a step toward establishing a national pharmacare program.  The budget also included funding for more support for people affected by dementia and autism spectrum disorder. See details <a href="http://mybrainmatters.ca/wp-content/uploads/FederalBudget2-2018ReactionMar2018.pdf">here.</a>
<h2>Canada needs an Action Plan for Brain Health now</h2>
NHCC urges the Government of Canada to immediately commit to developing a <strong>Canadian Action Plan for Brain Health</strong> to improve the lives of millions of Canadians living with brain conditions and their families.

The ground-breaking National Population Health Study of Neurological Conditions clearly identified what it means to live with a brain condition in Canada right now. Learn how a brain condition is affecting one individual right now: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih33EIKj9do">Meagan's Story</a>
<h2>Quick facts from the Study</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Unemployment among Canadians living with brain conditions is 12 times higher than the general population.</li>
 	<li>Canadians living with brain conditions use more health care services than those without a neurological condition or even those with other chronic conditions.</li>
 	<li>Half of all recipients of home care or in long-term care facilities have a brain condition.</li>
 	<li>Forty percent of children with brain conditions have limited educational opportunities.</li>
 	<li>Caregivers are essential to the well being of people living with brain conditions but caregivers often develop their own health problems including high levels of stress.</li>
 	<li>Without appropriate interventions, health care costs will increase significantly as will the overall impact on the Canadian economy.</li>
 	<li>By 2031, the number of Canadians with brain conditions will increase, and the number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury is expected to double.</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Action Plan is needed now</h2>
The burden of brain conditions will only increase unless we take action now.  See more details on the <a href="http://www.mybrainmatters.ca/research/national-population-health-study-of-neurological-conditions/">National Population Health Study</a> page and in the Study report: <a href="http://www.mybrainmatters.ca/wp-content/uploads/Mapping_Connections.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mapping Connections: An Understanding of Neurological Conditions in Canada</em></a>
